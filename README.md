# AI Disclosure

The Rust frontend was put together by Claude Opus. I reviewed everything that was
produced. All documentation is 100% free-range, meatbag prose.

The project is extremely low stakes. I wanted a bespoke frontend for my RG SP and thought
that something that evokes the feeling of using my GBA SP as a kid would be pretty neat.

Use it, don't use it, I don't care.

Figured I should share the end result of all the wasted water. ✌🏻
